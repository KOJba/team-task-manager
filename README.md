## About project
The main functions of this **web application** are to organize, create and assign team tasks. Users can create their own accounts and share their identification with others, and so they can create teams with other users, share their progress and view deadlines. Members of a team can aslo be assigned one of two roles: team member and manager.

## How did we develop the app?
For writing the code, launching, and testing we used NetBeans. Java version EE 8 Web and GlassFish server.
For database we used NetBeanss's build in database Derby, as it was convienient and easy to use. There is also a MC SQL Server DB in Database files, however we did not try connectiong and working with this database.
