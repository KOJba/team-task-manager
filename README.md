# team-task-manager
We as students were tasked to *simulate* a process of software development so this is our school project for subject **155-1325/01 – Vývoj informačních systémů (VIS)**.
Please if this does not concern you, do not alter any files.

## About project
The main functions of this **web application** are to organize, create and assign team tasks. Users can create their own accounts and share their identification with others, and so they can create teams with other users.

## How did we develop the app?
For writing the code, launching, and testing we used NetBeans. Java version EE 8 Web and GlassFish server.
For database we used NetBeanss's build in system Derby, as it was convienient and easy to use. There is also a MC SQL Server DB in Database files, however we did not try connectiong and working with this database.
